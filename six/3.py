#This code defines a Stud class that represents a student with a registration number, score, and grade. It has an __init__ method that initializes the student object with the given registration number, score, and grade. It also has a display method that prints a string representation of the student object, including its registration number, score, and grade.

# The code also creates three Stud objects: stud1, stud2, and stud3. These objects are initialized with different registration numbers, scores, and grades.
